# Breakout Game -Group 3
This is a Python-based Breakout game developed by Group 3 for the Capstone project. The game is built using the Pygame library and follows a modular, object-oriented structure.

## Features Implemented in Phase I
- Paddle movement using arrow keys
- Ball launch with randomized direction
- Brick wall generation with color gradients
- Collision detection (paddle, ball, and bricks)
- Menu, Help, and End game screens
- Score and lives tracking
- Unit testing using pytest
---

## Unit Testing
We used pytest to test logic-based components of the game (e.g., paddle movement, ball launch, score/lives updates). Test files are located in the `Code/tests` folder. Run the test suite with:
'python -m pytest tests/'
